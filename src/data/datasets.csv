Haibe-Kains,Dataset,2019,GSE88715,Gene expression profiles of microdissected tumor epithelium and stroma from TN breast tumors,"Engaging the immune system promises to be key for optimal cancer therapy, especially in hard-to-treat disease such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the immune microenvironment remains poorly understood. Using gene expression based on laser capture microdissection, we identify three distinct tumor microenvironments associated with CD8+ T cell localization patterns and outcome in TNBC. An immunoreactive microenvironment is defined by granzyme B-positive CD8+ T cell infiltration, a type I interferon signature, tumor expression of PD-L1 and good outcome. In contrast, tumors with an immune-cold microenvironment display restriction of CD8+ T cells to tumor margins, elevated tumor expression of the immunosuppressive marker B7-H4, a signature of desmoplastic stroma and poor outcome. A third distinct immunomodulatory microenvironment associated with poor outcome is enriched for IL-17-producing cells and neutrophils, as well as stroma-restricted localisation of CD8+ T cells.

Haibe-Kains,Dataset,2018,GSE99420,Gene Expression Signatures Prognostic for Relapse in Stage I Testicular Germ Cell Tumors (TGCT),"Design, Setting and Participants We reviewed patients with SI non-seminoma (NS) and seminoma (S) from an institutional database (2000-2012) managed with active surveillance. NR-NS and NR-S patients were defined as having no evidence of relapse after 2 and 3 years of surveillance respectively. RNA extraction and gene expression analysis was performed on archival primary tumor samples. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Gene-Set-Enrichment-Analysis (GSEA) was conducted in order to identify discriminating biological pathways associated with differentiation of R from NR and S from NS. Hierarchical clustering analysis and Wilcoxon testing were used to evaluate candidate genes and expression patterns that could differentiate NR from R. Results 57 patients (12 R-NS, 15 RS, 15 NR-NS, 15 NR-S) were identified with median relapse time of 5.6 (2.5-18.1) and 19.3 (4.7-65.3) months in NS and S cohorts respectively. 1039 differential expressed genes were identified that separated R and NR. In R patients, GSEA revealed enrichment in pathways associated with differentiation such as skeletal development (i.e. FGFR1, BMP4, GLI2, SPARC, COL2A1), tissue (i.e. BMP4, SPARC, COL13A1) and bone remodelling (i.e. CARTPT, GLI2, MGP). A discriminative gene expression profile between R and NR cases was discovered when combining NS and S samples using 10 (p=0.03) and 30 (p=0.03) probe signatures. However, this profile was not observed in the S and NS cohorts individually. Conclusions A discriminating signature for R and NR was identified for SI TGCT that was not histology specific. Genes associated with active differentiation were enriched in patients with R disease. Further validation is required to determine if this signature provides independent prognostic information to standard pathological risk factors.",,"Lewin J, Soltan Ghoraie L, Bedard PL, Hamilton RJ, Chung P, Moore M, Jewett MAS, Anson-Cartwright L, Virtanen C, Winegarden N, Tsao J, Warde P, Sweet J, Haibe-Kains B, Hansen AR",,,60,Expression profiling by array,"

Haibe-Kains,Dataset,2016,PharmacoGx,Contains a set of functions to perform large-scale analysis of pharmacogenomic data.,"High throughput drug screening technologies have enabled the profiling of hundreds of cancer cell lines to a large variety of small molecules to discover novel and repurposed treatments. Several large studies have been publicly released testing candidate molecules, often with corresponding molecular profiles of the cell lines used for drug screening. These studies have become invaluable resources for the research community, allowing researchers to leverage the collected data to support their own research. However, such pharmacogenomic datasets are disparate and lack of standardization for cell line and drug identifiers, and used heterogeneous data format for the drug sensitivity measurements.",3.1,"Petr Smirnov, Zhaleh Safikhani, Mark Freeman, Benjamin Haibe-Kains",Artistic-2.0,"Classification, GeneExpression, Pharmacogenetics, Pharmacogenomics, Software",1691,,"Smirnov P, Safikhani Z, El-Hachem N, Wang D, She A, Olsen C, Freeman M, Selby H, Gendoo D, Grossman P, Beck A, Aerts H, Lupien M, Haibe-Kains AG, (2016). “PharmacoGx: an R package for analysis of large pharmacogenomic datasets.” Bioinformatics (Oxford, England).",,,,https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/PharmacoGx.html,
Haibe-Kains,Dataset,2015,MM2Sdata,Contains normalized expression data for Human and Mouse Medulloblastoma models,"Molecular subtyping is instrumental towards selection of model systems for fundamental research in tumor pathogenesis, and clinical patient assessment. Medulloblastoma (MB) is a highly heterogeneous, malignant brain tumor that is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in children. Current MB classification schemes require large sample sizes, and standard reference samples, for subtype predictions. Such approaches are impractical in clinical settings with limited tumor biopsies, and unsuitable for model system predictions where standard reference samples are unavailable. Our developed Medullo-Model To Subtype (MM2S) classifier stratifies single MB gene expression profiles without reference samples or replicates. Our pathway-centric approach facilitates subtype predictions of patient samples, and model systems including cell lines and mouse models. MM2S demonstrates >96% accuracy for patients of well-characterized normal cerebellum, WNT, or SHH subtypes, and the less-characterized Group 4 (86%) and Group 3 (78.2%). MM2S also enables classification of MB cell lines and mouse models into their human counterparts.",1.0.3,"Deena M.A. Gendoo, Benjamin Haibe-Kains",GPL-3,,132,Expression profiling by array,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754315000774?via%3Dihub,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1975912219625140926&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MM2Sdata/index.html,
Haibe-Kains,Dataset,2013,GSE53091,Inference and validation of predictive gene networks from literature and gene expression data,"Although many methods have been developed for inference of biological networks, the validation of the resulting models has largely remained an unsolved problem. Here we present a framework for quantitative assessment of inferred gene interaction networks using knock-down data from cell line experiments. Using this framework we are able to show that network inference based on integration of prior knowledge derived from the biomedical literature with genomic data significantly improves the quality of inferred networks relative to other approaches. Our results also suggest that cell line experiments can be used to quantitatively assess the quality of networks inferred from tumor samples.",,"Olsen C, Fleming K, Prendergast N, Rubio R, Emmert-Streib F, Bontempi G, Haibe-Kains B, Quackenbush J

Haibe-Kains,Dataset,2013,GSE52550,loss of PGC-1alpha expression in aging muscle causes glucose intolerance and systemic inflammation,"	Decreased mitochondrial mass and function in muscle of diabetic patients is associated with low PGC-1alpha, a transcriptional coactivator of the mitochondrial gene program. To investigate whether reduced PGC-1alpha and oxidative capacity in muscle directly contributes to age-related glucose intolerance, we compared the genetic signatures and metabolic profiles of aging mice lacking muscle PGC-1alpha. Microarray analysis revealed that a significant proportion of PGC-1alpha-dependent changes in gene expression overlapped with age-associated effects, and aging muscle and muscle lacking PGC-1alpha shared gene signatures of impaired electron transport chain activity and TGFbeta signalling.",,"Sczelecki S, Besse-Patin A, Abboud A, Kleiner S, Laznik-Bogoslavski D, Wrann CD, Ruas JL, Haibe-Kains B, Estall JL",,,12,Expression profiling by array,"Sczelecki S, Besse-Patin A, Abboud A, Kleiner S et al.

Haibe-Kains,Dataset,2018,MetaGxOvarian,A collection of Ovarian Cancer Transcriptomic Datasets .,"It is difficult to predict the clinical outcome for patients with ovarian cancer. However, the use of biomarkers as additional prognostic factors may improve the outcome for these patients. In order to find novel candidate biomarkers, differences in gene expressions were analyzed in 54 stage III serous ovarian adenocarcinomas with oligonucleotide microarrays containing 27,000 unique robes. The microarray data was verified with a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for the genes TACC1, MUC5B and PRAME. Using hierarchical cluster analysis we detected a subgroup that included 60% of the survivors. The gene expressions in tumours from patients in this sub-group of survivors were compared with the remaining tumours, and 204 genes were found to be differently expressed. We conclude that the sub-group of survivors might represent patients with favourable tumour biology and sensitivity to treatment. A selection of the 204 genes might be used as a predictive model to distinguish patients within and outside of this group. Alternative chemotherapy strategies could then be offered as first-line treatment, which may lead to improvements in the clinical outcome for these patients.
