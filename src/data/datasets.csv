Pugh,,Targeted sequencing of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas,This dataset includes 112 head and neck tumour samples with matched normal (blood) samples sequenced using a custom hybrid capture panel.,"Overall survival remains very poor for patients diagnosed as having head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Identification of additional biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies are important for improving patient outcomes. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), generated by implanting fresh tumor tissue directly from patients into immunodeficient mice, recapitulate many of the features of their corresponding clinical cancers, including histopathological and molecular profiles. Using a large collection of PDX models of HNSCC, we demonstrate that rapid engraftment into immunocompromised mice is highly prognostic and show that genomic deregulation of the G1/S checkpoint pathway correlates with engraftment. Furthermore, CCND1 and CDKN2A genomic alterations are predictive of response to the CDK4and CDK6 inhibitor abemaciclib. Overall, our study supports the pursuit of CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for a substantial proportion of HNSCC patients and demonstrates the potential of using PDX models to identify targeted therapies that will benefit patients who have the poorest outcomes.",112,Agilent SureSelect custom in-solution hybrid capture panel / Illumina HiSeq 2000,primary tumour tissue,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00001002979,Yes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124718315675,"Christina Karamboulas, 	Jeffrey P.

Haibe-Kains,,GSE99420,Gene Expression Signatures Prognostic for Relapse in Stage I Testicular Germ Cell Tumors (TGCT),"Design, Setting and Participants We reviewed patients with SI non-seminoma (NS) and seminoma (S) from an institutional database (2000-2012) managed with active surveillance. NR-NS and NR-S patients were defined as having no evidence of relapse after 2 and 3 years of surveillance respectively. RNA extraction and gene expression analysis was performed on archival primary tumor samples. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Gene-Set-Enrichment-Analysis (GSEA) was conducted in order to identify discriminating biological pathways associated with differentiation of R from NR and S from NS. Hierarchical clustering analysis and Wilcoxon testing were used to evaluate candidate genes and expression patterns that could differentiate NR from R. Results 57 patients (12 R-NS, 15 RS, 15 NR-NS, 15 NR-S) were identified with median relapse time of 5.6 (2.5-18.1) and 19.3 (4.7-65.3) months in NS and S cohorts respectively. 1039 differential expressed genes were identified that separated R and NR. In R patients, GSEA revealed enrichment in pathways associated with differentiation such as skeletal development (i.e. FGFR1, BMP4, GLI2, SPARC, COL2A1), tissue (i.e. BMP4, SPARC, COL13A1) and bone remodelling (i.e. CARTPT, GLI2, MGP). A discriminative gene expression profile between R and NR cases was discovered when combining NS and S samples using 10 (p=0.03) and 30 (p=0.03) probe signatures. However, this profile was not observed in the S and NS cohorts individually. Conclusions A discriminating signature for R and NR was identified for SI TGCT that was not histology specific. Genes associated with active differentiation were enriched in patients with R disease. Further validation is required to determine if this signature provides independent prognostic information to standard pathological risk factors.",60,Expression profiling by array,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE99420,Yes,https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bju.14372,"Lewin J, Soltan Ghoraie L, Bedard PL, Hamilton RJ, Chung P, Moore M, Jewett MAS, Anson-Cartwright L, Virtanen C, Winegarden N, Tsao J, Warde P, Sweet J, Haibe-Kains B, Hansen AR",,Benjamin Haibe-Kains,benjamin.haibe-kains@uhnresearch.ca,,,,,2018,,,GSE99420,"

Haibe-Kains,,MM2Sdata,Contains normalized expression data for Human and Mouse Medulloblastoma models,"Molecular subtyping is instrumental towards selection of model systems for fundamental research in tumor pathogenesis, and clinical patient assessment. Medulloblastoma (MB) is a highly heterogeneous, malignant brain tumor that is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in children. Current MB classification schemes require large sample sizes, and standard reference samples, for subtype predictions. Such approaches are impractical in clinical settings with limited tumor biopsies, and unsuitable for model system predictions where standard reference samples are unavailable. Our developed Medullo-Model To Subtype (MM2S) classifier stratifies single MB gene expression profiles without reference samples or replicates. Our pathway-centric approach facilitates subtype predictions of patient samples, and model systems including cell lines and mouse models. MM2S demonstrates >96% accuracy for patients of well-characterized normal cerebellum, WNT, or SHH subtypes, and the less-characterized Group 4 (86%) and Group 3 (78.2%).

However, the use of biomarkers as additional prognostic factors may improve the outcome for these patients. In order to find novel candidate biomarkers, differences in gene expressions were analyzed in 54 stage III serous ovarian adenocarcinomas with oligonucleotide microarrays containing 27,000 unique robes. The microarray data was verified with a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for the genes TACC1, MUC5B and PRAME. Using hierarchical cluster analysis we detected a subgroup that included 60% of the survivors. The gene expressions in tumours from patients in this sub-group of survivors were compared with the remaining tumours, and 204 genes were found to be differently expressed. We conclude that the sub-group of survivors might represent patients with favourable tumour biology and sensitivity to treatment. A selection of the 204 genes might be used as a predictive model to distinguish patients within and outside of this group. Alternative chemotherapy strategies could then be offered as first-line treatment, which may lead to improvements in the clinical outcome for these patients.
